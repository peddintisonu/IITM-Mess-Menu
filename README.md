## 🎯 What is this?

This project is a user-friendly web application designed to help students at **IIT Madras** easily view their daily and weekly mess menus. It takes all the different mess schedules and presents them in a clean, interactive, and always up-to-date interface.

Simply open the app, and you'll instantly know what's for breakfast, lunch, snacks, and dinner.

## ✨ Key Features

This app is packed with features designed for a seamless and intelligent user experience.

### Smart & Personalized
*   **🧠 Intelligent "Today" View:** Automatically highlights the current or next upcoming meal and smoothly scrolls it into view on load. Past meals are visually de-emphasized.
*   **🔄 Cycle-Aware Preferences:** Set a different mess preference for each menu cycle. The app intelligently remembers your choice for the monsoon semester, winter break, and more.
*   **🚀 Proactive Onboarding:** When a new mess cycle begins, the app automatically prompts you to set your preference, ensuring a seamless transition.
*   **🎨 Light & Dark Modes:** A sleek interface that looks great day or night, with a manual toggle and respect for your system's theme.

### Powerful Tools
*   **📅 Historical Calendar:** Use the beautiful, themed calendar to view the menu for any past or future date within the available cycles.
*   **Full Week Explorer:** Toggle between the standard single-day view and a compact "Full Week" view to see the entire week's menu at a glance.
*   **🎉 Dynamic Event Menus:** The app automatically displays special, temporary menu changes for festivals and events, complete with a notification banner.
*   **⚙️ Advanced Settings:** Manage your preferences for previous, current, and next cycles, see a privacy notice, and reset the app if needed.

### Performance & Reliability
*   **⚡ Blazing Fast Performance:** Built with a "Static Shell" architecture. Skeletons prevent layout shift, and an anti-flash script ensures a smooth dark mode loading experience.
*   **📶 Full Offline Support:** As a Progressive Web App (PWA), the entire app and its menu data are cached, making it fully functional without an internet connection.
*   **⬆️ Instant App Updates:** A toast notification appears right in the app when a new version is deployed, allowing you to reload and get the latest features immediately.
